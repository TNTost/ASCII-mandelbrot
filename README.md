# ASCII-mandelbrot
source code for an ASCII mandelbrot zoom


if you're here from my YT, hai there .o/. 
the file mandelbrot.c is my attempt at a visual "hello world". 
I posted it here for those interested in the source code and or wanting to play around with the variables a bit. 
feel free to edit to your desires :).
